## Goals

1. Voice assistant: always listen
2. Question-answer lookup
3. External APIs: YouTube, Spotify, Twitter
4. Assumptions: just play an Arctic Monkeys song when asked "play Arctic Monkeys". Then either learn from words of affirmation: "I like this one," or change song if rejected.
5. Code by voice
6. File manipulation: panning, scrolling, etc.. Think Blade Runner
